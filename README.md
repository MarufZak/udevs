Notes:
1. Everything is accessible for keyboard users with focus states for every component.
2. Orders are customizable (src/app/dashboard/orders/constants.js).
3. Although it's admin panel, NextJS is used for demo purposes.
4. I didn't understand the component near select in dashboard, so i made it timer.
5. Hover and focus states were not shown in design, so i made them as in demo.
